# slate-watchface-template

This is an example app that uses the 
[Slate front-end framework](https://github.com/pebble/slate) to allow users to 
easily use config options.

The `master` branch is the finished app, with the `starter-app` branch design
for users to follow along with the 
[video tutorial](https://github.com/pebble/slate#video-tutorial) from the Pebble
SF Config Workshop.
